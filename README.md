# ObjectOrientedProgramming

For this task I had to create a project management system for a small structural engineering firm called 'Poised Stuctural Engineers'.
They required me to create a Java program that they can use to keep track of the many projects on which they work.

* The following information needs to be stored for each project that they work on:
  * Project number;
  * Project name;
  * What type of building is being designed: E.g. House, apartment block or store, etc;
  * The physical address for the project;
  * ERF number;
  * The total fee being charged for the project;
  * The total amount paid to date;
  * Deadline for the project;
  * The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the architect for the project;
  * The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the contractor for the project;
  * The name, telephone number, email address and physical address of the customer for the project;
  * The total amount still outstandong.
